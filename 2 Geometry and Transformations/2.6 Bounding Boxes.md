# 2.6 Bounding Boxes

pbrt uses **axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs)**, where the box edges are mutually perpendicular and aligned with the coordinate system axes.

A 3D AABB can be described by one of its vertices and three lengths, each representing the distance spanned along the x, y, and z coordinate axes.

Alternatively, two opposite vertices of the box can describe it. We chose the two-point representation for pbrt’s Bounds2 and Bounds3 classes; they store the positions of the vertex with minimum coordinate values and of the one with maximum coordinate values.

---
1. If the caller passes two corner points (p1 and p2) to define the box, the constructor needs to find their component-wise minimum and maximum values since p1 and p2 are not necessarily chosen so that p1.x <= p2.x, and so on.
2. In some cases, it’s also useful to use array indexing to select between the two points at the corners of the box. The implementations of these methods select between pMin and pMax based on the value of i.
3. The Corner() method returns the coordinates of one of the **eight corners** of the bounding box.
4. The Lerp() method linearly interpolates between the corners of the box by the given amount in each dimension.
5. Offset() returns the continuous position of a point relative to the corners of the box, where a point at the minimum corner has offset (0,0,0), a point at the maximum corner has offset (1,1,1), and so forth.

Given **a bounding box and a point**, the **Union() function** returns a new bounding box that encompasses that point as well as the original box.
```c
//<<Geometry Inline Functions>>+=  
template <typename T> Bounds3 <T>
Union(const Bounds3<T> &b, const Point3<T> &p) {
    return Bounds3<T>(Point3<T>(std::min(b.pMin.x, p.x),
                                std::min(b.pMin.y, p.y),
                                std::min(b.pMin.z, p.z)),
                      Point3<T>(std::max(b.pMax.x, p.x),
                                std::max(b.pMax.y, p.y),
                                std::max(b.pMax.z, p.z)));
}
```
It is similarly possible to construct a new box that bounds the space encompassed by **two other bounding boxes**. The definition of this function is similar to the earlier Union() method that takes a Point3f; the difference is that the pMin and pMax of the second box are used for the std::min() and std::max() tests, respectively.
```c
//<<Geometry Inline Functions>>+=  
template <typename T> Bounds3<T>
Union(const Bounds3<T> &b1, const Bounds3<T> &b2) {
    return Bounds3<T>(Point3<T>(std::min(b1.pMin.x, b2.pMin.x),
                                std::min(b1.pMin.y, b2.pMin.y),
                                std::min(b1.pMin.z, b2.pMin.z)),
                      Point3<T>(std::max(b1.pMax.x, b2.pMax.x),
                                std::max(b1.pMax.y, b2.pMax.y),
                                std::max(b1.pMax.z, b2.pMax.z)));
}
```

The **intersection** of two bounding boxes can be found by computing the maximum of their two respective minimum coordinates and the minimum of their maximum coordinates.
```c
//<<Geometry Inline Functions>>+=  
template <typename T> Bounds3<T>
Intersect(const Bounds3<T> &b1, const Bounds3<T> &b2) {
    return Bounds3<T>(Point3<T>(std::max(b1.pMin.x, b2.pMin.x), // max()
                                std::max(b1.pMin.y, b2.pMin.y),
                                std::max(b1.pMin.z, b2.pMin.z)),
                      Point3<T>(std::min(b1.pMax.x, b2.pMax.x), //min()
                                std::min(b1.pMax.y, b2.pMax.y),
                                std::min(b1.pMax.z, b2.pMax.z)));
}
```

We are able to determine if two bounding boxes **overlap** by seeing if their extents overlap in **all of** x, y, and z:
```c
//<<Geometry Inline Functions>>+=  
template <typename T>
bool Overlaps(const Bounds3<T> &b1, const Bounds3<T> &b2) {
    bool x = (b1.pMax.x >= b2.pMin.x) && (b1.pMin.x <= b2.pMax.x);
    bool y = (b1.pMax.y >= b2.pMin.y) && (b1.pMin.y <= b2.pMax.y);
    bool z = (b1.pMax.z >= b2.pMin.z) && (b1.pMin.z <= b2.pMax.z);
    return (x && y && z);
}
```

Three 1D containment tests determine if a given point is **inside** the bounding box:
```c
//<<Geometry Inline Functions>>+=  
template <typename T>
bool Inside(const Point3<T> &p, const Bounds3<T> &b) {
    return (p.x >= b.pMin.x && p.x <= b.pMax.x &&
            p.y >= b.pMin.y && p.y <= b.pMax.y &&
            p.z >= b.pMin.z && p.z <= b.pMax.z);
}
```

The InsideExclusive() variant of Inside() **doesn’t consider points on the upper boundary** to be inside the bounds. It is mostly useful with integer-typed bounds.
```c
<<Geometry Inline Functions>>+=  
template <typename T>
bool InsideExclusive(const Point3<T> &p, const Bounds3<T> &b) {
    return (p.x >= b.pMin.x && p.x < b.pMax.x &&
            p.y >= b.pMin.y && p.y < b.pMax.y &&
            p.z >= b.pMin.z && p.z < b.pMax.z);
}
```

The Expand() function pads the bounding box by a constant factor **in all dimensions**.
```c
<<Geometry Inline Functions>>+=  
template <typename T, typename U> inline Bounds3<T>
Expand(const Bounds3<T> &b, U delta) { // delta
    return Bounds3<T>(b.pMin - Vector3<T>(delta, delta, delta),
                      b.pMax + Vector3<T>(delta, delta, delta));
}
```
