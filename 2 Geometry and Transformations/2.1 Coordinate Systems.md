# origin + basis vectors = frame
... pbrt represents three-dimensional **points**, **vectors**, and **normal vectors** with three coordinate values: x, y, and z. These values are **meaningless** without a **coordinate system** that

1. defines the origin of the space and
2. gives three linearly independent vectors that define the x, y, and z axes of the space.

Together, the **origin** and **three vectors** are called the **frame** that defines the coordinate system. Given an arbitrary point or direction in 3D, its $(x,y,z)$ coordinate values depend on its relationship to the frame.

In the general n-dimensional case, a frameâ€™s **origin** $p_0$ and its $n$ linearly independent **basis vectors** define **an n-dimensional affine space**.

# vector vs point
For vector $v$, there are unique scalars $s_i$ such that
$$v = s_1v_1 + ... + s_nv_n$$
The scalars $s_i$ are the representation of vector $v$ with respect to the basis $\{v_1, v_2, ... , v_n\}$ and are the coordinate values that we store with the vector.

For point, there are unique scalars $s_i$ such that the point can be expressed in terms of the **origin** $p_0$ and the **basis vectors**
$$p = p_0 + s_1v_1 + ... + s_nv_n$$

they are **distinct mathematical entities** and are **not freely interchangeable**.

# world space, beautiful reasoning
This definition of points and vectors in terms of coordinate systems reveals a **paradox**: to define a frame we need a point and a set of vectors, but we can only meaningfully talk about points and vectors with respect to a particular frame.

Therefore, in three dimensions we need **a standard frame with origin $(0,0,0)$** and basis vectors $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$. All other frames will be defined with respect to this canonical coordinate system, which we call **world space**.
