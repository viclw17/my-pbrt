In general, a transformation T is a mapping from points to points and from vectors to vectors: $p' = T(p), v' = T(v)$

1. Linear
2. Continuous
3. One-to-one and invertible

- Transformation of the frame: Given a point, the matrix could express how to compute a new point in the same frame that represents the transformation of the original point (e.g., by translating it in some direction).
- Transformation from one frame to another: A matrix can express the coordinates of a point or vector in a new frame in terms of the coordinates in the original frame. (**Most uses**)

# Camera analogy
In general, transformations make it possible to work in the most convenient coordinate space. For example, we can write routines that define a **virtual camera**, assuming that the camera is **located at the origin, looks z the  axis, and has the y axis pointing up and the x axis pointing right.** These assumptions greatly simplify the camera implementation. Then, to place the camera at any point in the scene looking in any direction, we just construct a transformation that maps points in the scene’s coordinate system to the camera’s coordinate system.

# 2.7.1 Homogeneous Coordinates
http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Geometry_and_Transformations/Transformations.html#HomogeneousCoordinates

Given a frame defined by $(p_0, v_1, v_2, v_3)$, there is ambiguity between the representation of a point $(p_x, p_y, p_z)$ and a vector $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ with the same $(x,y,z)$ coordinates.

- Point, $[s_1 s_2 s_3 1][v_1 v_2 v_3 p_0]^T$
- Vector, $[s_1 s_2 s_3 0][v_1 v_2 v_3 p_0]^T$

These four-vectors of three $s_i$ values and a $0$ or $1$ are called the **homogeneous representations of the point and the vector**.

The fourth coordinate of the homogeneous representation is sometimes called the **weight**. For a point, its value can be any scalar other than zero. Converting homogeneous points into ordinary points entails **dividing the first three components by the weight**.

In general, by characterizing **how the basis is transformed**, we know how any point or vector specified in terms of that basis is transformed.

We will **not use homogeneous coordinates explicitly** in our code; However, the various transformation routines in the next section will **implicitly** convert points, vectors, and normals to homogeneous form, transform the homogeneous points, and then convert them back before returning the result.

# memory hungry
A transformation is represented by the elements of the matrix m, **a ```Matrix4x4``` object (struct)**. The low-level Matrix4x4 class is defined in Section A.5.3. The matrix m is stored in **row-major** form, so element ```m[i][j]``` corresponds to $m_{i,j}$, where  is the row number and  is the column number.

For convenience, the Transform **also stores the inverse of the matrix m** in the ```Transform::mInv``` member; for pbrt’s needs, it is better to have the inverse easily available than to repeatedly compute it as needed.

This representation of transformations is relatively memory hungry: assuming 4 bytes of storage for a Float value, a Transform requires 128 bytes of storage. **Used naïvely, this approach can be wasteful**; if a scene has millions of shapes but only a few thousand unique transformations, there’s no reason to redundantly store the same transform many times in memory. Therefore, ```Shapes``` in pbrt **store a pointer to a Transform**, and the scene specification code defined in Section A.3.5 uses a ```TransformCache``` to ensure that all shapes that share the same transformation point to a single instance of that transformation in memory.

# basic operation
When a new Transform is created, it **defaults to the identity transformation** —the transformation that maps each point and each vector to itself.
