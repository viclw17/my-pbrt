pbrt hides details about primitives behind a **two-level abstraction**.

1. The **Shape** class provides access to the raw geometric properties of the primitive, such as its **surface area** and **bounding box**, and provides a **ray intersection** routine.
2. The **Primitive** class encapsulates additional nongeometric information about the primitive, such as its material properties. The rest of the renderer then deals only with the abstract Primitive interface.

This chapter will focus on the geometry-only Shape class; the Primitive interface is a key topic of Chapter 4.

The Shape base class defines the general Shape **interface**.

All shapes are defined in **object coordinate space**; for example, all spheres are defined in a coordinate system where the center of the sphere is at the origin. In order to place a sphere at another position in the scene, a transformation that describes the mapping from object space to world space must be provided. The Shape class stores **both this transformation and its inverse**.

Shapes also take a Boolean parameter, reverseOrientation, that indicates whether their surface normal directions should be reversed from the default. This capability is useful because the orientation of the surface normal is used to determine which side of a shape is “outside.” For example, shapes that emit illumination are emissive only on the side the surface normal lies on. The value of this parameter is managed via the ReverseOrientation statement in pbrt input files.

Shapes also **store the return value of the Transform::SwapsHandedness()** call for their object-to-world transformation. This value is needed by the SurfaceInteraction constructor that is called each time a ray intersection is found, so the Shape constructor computes it once and stores it.

**Declaration**, in .h
```c
Shape(const Transform *ObjectToWorld, const Transform *WorldToObject, bool reverseOrientation);
```
**constructor Method Definition**, in .cpp, initialize all public data
```c
<<Shape Method Definitions>>=
Shape::Shape(const Transform *ObjectToWorld, const Transform *WorldToObject, bool reverseOrientation) : ObjectToWorld(ObjectToWorld), WorldToObject(WorldToObject), reverseOrientation(reverseOrientation), transformSwapsHandedness(ObjectToWorld -> SwapsHandedness()) {
}
```
 **store pointers to their transformations** rather than Transform objects directly

# 3.1.1 Bounding
Each Shape implementation must therefore be capable of **bounding itself with an axis-aligned bounding box** represented by a Bounds3f. There are two different bounding methods.

1. The first, ObjectBound(), returns a bounding box in the shape’s **object space**.
2. The second bounding method, WorldBound(), returns a bounding box in **world space**.
```c
<<Shape Method Definitions>>+=  
Bounds3f Shape::WorldBound() const {
    return (*ObjectToWorld)(ObjectBound());
}
```
> ```*ObjectToWorld``` dereference the pointer, then transform ObjectBound()

# 3.1.2 Ray–Bounds Intersections
One way to think of bounding boxes is as the intersection of **three slabs**, where a slab is the region of space between two parallel planes. To intersect a ray against a box, we **intersect the ray against each of the box’s three slabs in turn**. Because the slabs are aligned with the three coordinate axes, a number of optimizations can be made in the ray–slab tests.

```c
bool IntersectP(const Ray &ray, Float *hitt0 = nullptr, Float *hitt1 = nullptr) const;
//...                    
template <typename T>
inline bool Bounds3<T>::IntersectP(const Ray &ray, Float *hitt0,
                                   Float *hitt1) const {
    Float t0 = 0, t1 = ray.tMax;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        // Update interval for _i_th bounding box slab
        Float invRayDir = 1 / ray.d[i];
        Float tNear = (pMin[i] - ray.o[i]) * invRayDir;
        Float tFar = (pMax[i] - ray.o[i]) * invRayDir;

        // Update parametric interval from slab intersection $t$ values
        if (tNear > tFar) std::swap(tNear, tFar);

        // Update _tFar_ to ensure robust ray--bounds intersection
        tFar *= 1 + 2 * gamma(3);

        t0 = tNear > t0 ? tNear : t0;
        t1 = tFar < t1 ? tFar : t1;

        if (t0 > t1) return false;
    }

    if (hitt0) *hitt0 = t0;
    if (hitt1) *hitt1 = t1;
    return true;
}
```
For each pair of planes, this routine needs to compute two ray–plane intersections.

Bounds3 also provides **a specialized IntersectP() method** that takes the reciprocal of the ray’s direction as an additional parameter, so that the three reciprocals don’t need to be computed each time IntersectP() is called.

This version **also takes precomputed values that indicate whether each direction component is negative**, which makes it possible to eliminate the comparisons of the computed tNear and tFar values in the original routine and just directly compute the respective near and far values. Because the comparisons that order these values from low to high in the original code are dependent on computed values, they can be inefficient for processors to execute, since the computation of their values must be completely finished before the comparison can be made.

```c
inline bool IntersectP(const Ray &ray, const Vector3f &invDir, const int dirIsNeg[3]) const;
//...
template <typename T>
inline bool Bounds3<T>::IntersectP(const Ray &ray, const Vector3f &invDir,
                                   const int dirIsNeg[3]) const {
    const Bounds3f &bounds = *this;
    // Check for ray intersection against $x$ and $y$ slabs
    Float tMin = (bounds[dirIsNeg[0]].x - ray.o.x) * invDir.x;
    Float tMax = (bounds[1 - dirIsNeg[0]].x - ray.o.x) * invDir.x;
    Float tyMin = (bounds[dirIsNeg[1]].y - ray.o.y) * invDir.y;
    Float tyMax = (bounds[1 - dirIsNeg[1]].y - ray.o.y) * invDir.y;

    // Update _tMax_ and _tyMax_ to ensure robust bounds intersection
    tMax *= 1 + 2 * gamma(3);
    tyMax *= 1 + 2 * gamma(3);
    if (tMin > tyMax || tyMin > tMax) return false;
    if (tyMin > tMin) tMin = tyMin;
    if (tyMax < tMax) tMax = tyMax;

    // Check for ray intersection against $z$ slab
    Float tzMin = (bounds[dirIsNeg[2]].z - ray.o.z) * invDir.z;
    Float tzMax = (bounds[1 - dirIsNeg[2]].z - ray.o.z) * invDir.z;

    // Update _tzMax_ to ensure robust bounds intersection
    tzMax *= 1 + 2 * gamma(3);
    if (tMin > tzMax || tzMin > tMax) return false;
    if (tzMin > tMin) tMin = tzMin;
    if (tzMax < tMax) tMax = tzMax;
    return (tMin < ray.tMax) && (tMax > 0);
}
```

This intersection test is at the heart of traversing the BVHAccel acceleration structure, which is introduced in Section 4.3. Because so many ray–bounding box intersection tests are performed while traversing the BVH tree, we found that this optimized method provided approximately a 15% performance improvement in overall rendering time compared to using the Bounds3::IntersectP() variant that didn’t take the precomputed direction reciprocals and signs.
