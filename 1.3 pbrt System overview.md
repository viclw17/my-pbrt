## Integrator interface
Rendering an image of the scene is handled by an instance of a class that implements the Integrator interface.

- class -> instanced
- interface -> implemented

```Integrator``` is an abstract base class/interface. ```Render()``` is a **pure virtual method** that must be implemented by all integrators.

```c
// Integrator Declarations
class Integrator {
  public:
    // Integrator Interface
    virtual ~Integrator();
    virtual void Render(const Scene &scene) = 0;
};
```

> Make a class with pure virtual methods. Use the interface by creating another class that overrides those virtual methods. A pure virtual method is a class method that is defined as virtual and assigned to 0.
> ...you may want to make one exception to the pure virtual method list of your interface by adding _a virtual destructor_. This allows you to _pass pointer ownership to another party without exposing the concrete derived class_. The destructor doesn't have to do anything, because the interface doesn't have any concrete members. It might seem contradictory to define a function as both virtual and inline, but trust me - it isn't.

```c
class IDemo{
public:
    virtual ~IDemo() {}
    virtual void OverrideMe() = 0;
};

class Parent{
public:
    virtual ~Parent();
};

class Child : public Parent, public IDemo{
public:
    virtual void OverrideMe(){
        //do stuff
    }
};
```

The basic integrator interfaces are defined in integrator.h,
some **utility functions** are in integrator.cpp.

## SamplerIntegrator
```c
// SamplerIntegrator Declarations
class SamplerIntegrator : public Integrator {
  public:
    // SamplerIntegrator Public Methods
    SamplerIntegrator(std::shared_ptr<const Camera> camera,
                      std::shared_ptr<Sampler> sampler,
                      const Bounds2i &pixelBounds)
        : camera(camera), sampler(sampler), pixelBounds(pixelBounds) {}

    void Render(const Scene &scene);
    // ...

protected:
  // SamplerIntegrator Protected Data
  std::shared_ptr<const Camera> camera;

private:
  // SamplerIntegrator Private Data
  std::shared_ptr<Sampler> sampler;
  // ...
};
```

store a pointer to a ```Sampler```.

1. sampler is responsible for choosing the points on the **image plane** from which rays are traced.
2. responsible for supplying the sample positions used by integrators for estimating the value of **light transport integral** = rendering equation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer

store a pointer to a Camera

1. ```Camera``` object controls the **viewing** and lens parameters: position, orientation, focus, fov.
2. ```Film``` member variable inside ```Camera``` class handles **image storage**: writing the final image and display on the screen.



# 1.3.4 The main rendering loop
core/integrator.cpp
## Render()
... at each of a series of positions on the **image plane**, the method uses the ```Camera``` and the ```Sampler``` to generate a ray into the scene and then uses ```Li()``` method to determine the amount of light arriving at the image plane along that ray. The value is passed to ```Film``` to record the light's contribution.

- Li() returns **radiance**, represented as **Spectrum**
- Li() is a pure virtual method returns incident radiance at the origin of the given ray.

```c
virtual Spectrum Li(const RayDifferential &ray,
                    const Scene &scene,
                    Sampler &sampler,
                    MemoryArena &arena,
                    int depth = 0) const = 0;
```
1. ray, along which incident radiance evaluated
2. scene, query the scene for info about lights and geos...
3. sampler, a sampler generrator used to solve light transport qeuation AKA rendering equation, using MC integration.
4. Memory Arena
5. depth, the number of ray bounces from the camera occurred, up until the current call of Li()


### Parallel pixel looping, TODO! Page 27-30
Lambda expression
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function

blahblahblah parallel...

Loop over pixels in tile.
1. Initialize CameraSampler for current sample.
2. Generate camera ray for current sample.
3. Evaluate radiance along camera ray. **Li() method!!!**
    1. _Issue warning if unexpected radiance value returned_
4. Add camera ray's contribution to image. filmTile->AddSample(cameraSample.pFilm, L, rayWeight);
