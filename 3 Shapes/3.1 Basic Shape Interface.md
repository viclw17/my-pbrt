pbrt hides details about primitives behind a **two-level abstraction**.

1. The **Shape** class provides access to the raw geometric properties of the primitive, such as its **surface area** and **bounding box**, and provides a **ray intersection** routine.
2. The **Primitive** class encapsulates additional nongeometric information about the primitive, such as its material properties. The rest of the renderer then deals only with the abstract Primitive interface.

This chapter will focus on the geometry-only Shape class; the Primitive interface is a key topic of Chapter 4.

The Shape base class defines the general Shape **interface**. 

**Declaration**, in .h
```c
Shape(const Transform *ObjectToWorld, const Transform *WorldToObject, bool reverseOrientation);
```
**constructor Method Definition**, in .cpp, initialize all public data
```c
<<Shape Method Definitions>>=
Shape::Shape(const Transform *ObjectToWorld, const Transform *WorldToObject, bool reverseOrientation) : ObjectToWorld(ObjectToWorld), WorldToObject(WorldToObject), reverseOrientation(reverseOrientation), transformSwapsHandedness(ObjectToWorld -> SwapsHandedness()) {
}
```
 **store pointers to their transformations** rather than Transform objects directly

Each Shape implementation must therefore be capable of **bounding itself with an axis-aligned bounding box** represented by a Bounds3f. There are two different bounding methods.

1. The first, ObjectBound(), returns a bounding box in the shapeâ€™s **object space**.
2. The second bounding method, WorldBound(), returns a bounding box in **world space**.
```c
<<Shape Method Definitions>>+=  
Bounds3f Shape::WorldBound() const {
    return (*ObjectToWorld)(ObjectBound());
}
```
> *ObjectToWorld dereference the pointer, then transform ObjectBound()
