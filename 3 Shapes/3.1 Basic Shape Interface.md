pbrt hides details about primitives behind a **two-level abstraction**.

1. The **Shape** class provides access to the raw geometric properties of the primitive, such as its **surface area** and **bounding box**, and provides a **ray intersection** routine.
2. The **Primitive** class encapsulates additional nongeometric information about the primitive, such as its material properties. The rest of the renderer then deals only with the abstract Primitive interface.

This chapter will focus on the geometry-only Shape class; the Primitive interface is a key topic of Chapter 4.

The Shape base class defines the general Shape **interface**. It also exposes a few public data members that are useful for all Shape implementations.
